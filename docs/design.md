# Design Specification

## Introduction

### Overview

This document provides a complete overview of the design and functionality of the Mujo Industry Portal. It is based upon the use cases, user requirement specification, and collaboration with the Mujo team.

### Related documents

* The [Technical specification](tech.md) lays out precisely how the application will be built, tested and deployed.
* The [User requirement specification]() provides the detail of what is required by the user.

## Screens

### 1. Home page

#### Description

The home page provides the landing page for when users arrive at the dashboard. It will contain high level text (to be provided by Mujo) explaining what the dashboard is and how it fits within the project.

A title bar at the top of the screen provides access to the dashboard - as does a large button in the centre of the screen.

A future version may have the ability for users to log in. There would then be a drop down menu in the top right showing who is logged in and allowing users to change/delete their profile and log out. However this will not be delivered as part of the current project.

### 2. Dashboard overview

#### Description

The user is presented with an overview of the various features in the dashboard.

A menu on the left hand side provides the four areas of the dashboard that are available to the user:

* overview
* top 10
* distributions
* predictive model

The main body of the page displays a summary box giving the following information:

* When the data was last updated
* Total number of patients (and number who are active)
* The total number of locations, physios, prescriptions

There is then also the first few elements from the "top 10" and the "distributions" pages, with a link to see more taking the user to the relevant section of the dashboard.
